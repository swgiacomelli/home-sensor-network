# Home Sensor Network

## About

This repository contains code and instructions to setup a simple home sensor network using [ESP82866](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) modules with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) connected via an MQTT network backed by [Mosquito](https://mosquitto.org/), [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/), [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

## Architecture

Initially the IoT device is not configured.

![IoT device creates a WiFi access point to run a configuration web server](docs/images/Step_1_Diagram.png)

After being configured the IoT device start publishing to the MQTT server.

![Once the IoT device is configured it switches to sensor mode and connects to the MQTT server via an existing WiFi access point](docs/images/Step_2_Diagram.png)

Finally the backend services via the MQTT server subscribe to the sensor data published by the IoT device allowing dashboards and more to be created.

![The backend database then subscribes via the MQTT server to the sensor data published by the IoT device with the dashboard connected to the database](docs/images/Step_3_Diagram.png)
