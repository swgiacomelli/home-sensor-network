# Docker Secure

This creates self-signed certificates and securely generated passwords for [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). The certificates for the mqtt server are generated by [generate.sh](../scripts/cert-gen/generate.sh) which also generates the IoT device certificates.

```bash
cd ../scripts/cert-gen/
./generate.sh
cd ../../docker-secure
./generate.sh
docker-compose up
```
